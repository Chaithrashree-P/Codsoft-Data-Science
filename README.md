# Iris Flower Classification

This project involves classifying Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements. The Iris dataset, which is widely used for introductory classification tasks, is used to train and evaluate the model.

## Introduction

The Iris flower dataset is a classic dataset for pattern recognition. It contains 150 observations of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The objective is to classify the iris flowers into three species based on these measurements.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica). There are four features measured from each sample: the lengths and the widths of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:
